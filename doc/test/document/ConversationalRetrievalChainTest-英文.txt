Once upon a time, there was a lovely little girl who always wore a red hat given by her grandmother, so everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day, my mother said to Little Red Riding Hood, "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a cake and a bottle of wine. Grandma is sick, hurry up and bring it to her.". Be careful on the road!
Little Red Riding Hood said to her mother, "Okay, I will be careful.". I'm going to see my grandmother! After finishing speaking, Little Red Riding Hood happily left. She ran into a wolf as soon as she entered the forest.
Little Red Riding Hood said, "I'm going to my grandmother's house.". My grandmother is sick, and I brought her delicious cake and wine.
So it said to Little Red Riding Hood: Little Red Riding Hood, look at how beautiful these flowers are around you! Pick some for your grandmother, she will definitely be very happy.
Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself, "Yes, these flowers are so beautiful. Grandma will definitely be very happy.". So she started picking flowers. At this moment, the wolf took the opportunity to run to his grandmother's house and swallowed her in one gulp. He then put on his grandmother's clothes and lay in bed wearing her hat.
After a while, Little Red Riding Hood arrived at her grandmother's house and walked to her bed. The wolf pounced and swallowed Little Red Riding Hood in one gulp. When the wolf was full, it lay down on the bed and fell asleep.
A hunter walked by and saw that his grandmother's door was open. So, he walked in and saw the wolf lying in bed with its stomach still moving. So, the hunter picked up a pair of scissors and cut open the wolf's stomach.
Little Red Riding Hood and Grandma were both rescued when the hunter brought a few large stones and stuffed them into the wolf's belly. The wolf woke up and wanted to escape, but the stones were too heavy. As soon as it stood up, it fell to the ground and died.
Grandma ate the cake and wine brought by Little Red Riding Hood and felt much better. They were extremely happy!
